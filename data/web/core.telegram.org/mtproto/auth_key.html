  <div id="dev_page_content"><p>The query format is described using <a href="/mtproto/serialize">Binary Data Serialization</a> and the <a href="/mtproto/TL">TL Language</a>. All large numbers are transmitted as strings containing the required sequence of bytes in big endian order. Hash functions, such as SHA1, return strings (of 20 bytes) which can also be interpreted as big endian numbers. Small numbers (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>int128</code>, <code>int256</code>) are normally little endian; however, if they are part of SHA1, the bytes are not rearranged. This way, if <code>long</code> <code>x</code> is the 64 lower-order bits of SHA1 of string <code>s</code>, then the <em>final</em> 8 bytes of 20-byte string <code>SHA1(s)</code> are taken and interpreted as a 64-bit integer.</p>
<p>Prior to sending off unencrypted messages (required in this instance to generate an authorization key), the client must undergo (p,q) authorization as follows.</p>

<pre><code>req_pq_multi#be7e8ef1 nonce:int128 = ResPQ;</code></pre>
<p>The value of <em>nonce</em> is selected randomly by the client (random number) and identifies the client within this communication. Following this step, it is known to all.</p>
<h5><a class="anchor" href="#2-server-sends-response-of-the-form" id="2-server-sends-response-of-the-form" name="2-server-sends-response-of-the-form"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2) Server sends response of the form</h5>
<pre><code>resPQ#05162463 nonce:int128 server_nonce:int128 pq:string server_public_key_fingerprints:Vector long = ResPQ;</code></pre>
<p>Here, string pq is a representation of a natural number (in binary big endian format). This number is the product of two different odd prime numbers. Normally, pq is less than or equal to 2^63-1. The value of <em>server_nonce</em> is selected randomly by the server; following this step, it is known to all.</p>
<p><code>server_public_key_fingerprints</code> is a list of public RSA key fingerprints (64 lower-order bits of SHA1 (server_public_key); the public key is represented as a bare type <code>rsa_public_key n:string e:string = RSAPublicKey</code>, where, as usual, n and e are numbers in big endian format serialized as strings of bytes, following which SHA1 is computed) received by the server.</p>
<p>All subsequent messages contain the pair (nonce, server_nonce) both in the plain-text, and the encrypted portions which makes it possible to identify a “temporary session” — one run of the key generation protocol described on this page that uses the same (nonce, server_nonce) pair. An intruder could not create a parallel session with the server with the same parameters and reuse parts of server- or client-encrypted messages for its own purposes in such a parallel session, because a different server_nonce would be selected by the server for any new “temporary session”.</p>

<h5><a class="anchor" href="#4-encrypted-data-payload-generation" id="4-encrypted-data-payload-generation" name="4-encrypted-data-payload-generation"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4) <code>encrypted_data</code> payload generation</h5>
<p>First of all, generate an <code>encrypted_data</code> payload as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>new_nonce := another (good) random number generated by the client; after this query, it is known to both client and server;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>data := a serialization of </p>
<pre><code>p_q_inner_data_dc#a9f55f95 pq:string p:string q:string nonce:int128 server_nonce:int128 new_nonce:int256 dc:int = P_Q_inner_data;</code></pre>
<p>or of</p>
<pre><code>p_q_inner_data_temp_dc#56fddf88 pq:string p:string q:string nonce:int128 server_nonce:int128 new_nonce:int256 dc:int expires_in:int = P_Q_inner_data;</code></pre>
<p>where <code>dc</code> is the ID of the DC we're talking to; <code>10000</code> has to be added to the DC ID when connecting to the test servers; it has to be made negative if the DC we're connecting to is a media (not CDN) DC.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encrypted_data := RSA_PAD (data, server_public_key), where RSA_PAD is a version of RSA with a variant of OAEP+ padding explained below in 4.1).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone might intercept the query and replace it with their own, independently decomposing pq into factors instead of the client. The only field that it makes sense to modify is new_nonce which would be the one an intruder would have to re-generate (because an intruder cannot decrypt the encrypted data sent by the client). Since all subsequent messages are encrypted using new_nonce or contain new_nonce_hash, they will not be processed by the client (an intruder would not be able to make it look as though they had been generated by the server because they would not contain new_nonce). Therefore, this intercept will only result in the intruder's completing the authorization key generation protocol in place of the client and creating a new key (that has nothing to do with the client); however, the same effect could be achieved simply by creating a new key in one's own name.</p>
<p>An alternative form of inner data (<code>p_q_inner_data_temp_dc</code>) is used to create temporary keys, that are only stored in the server RAM and are discarded after at most <code>expires_in</code> seconds. The server is free to discard its copy earlier. In all other respects the temporary key generation protocol is the same. After a temporary key is created, the client usually binds it to its principal authorisation key by means of the <a href="/method/auth.bindTempAuthKey">auth.bindTempAuthKey</a> method, and uses it for all client-server communication until it expires; then a new temporary key is generated. Thus Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) in client-server communication is achieved. <a href="/api/pfs">Read more about PFS »</a></p>

<ul>
<li>data_with_padding := data + random_padding_bytes; -- where random_padding_bytes are chosen so that the resulting length of data_with_padding is precisely 192 bytes, and data is the TL-serialized data to be encrypted as before. One has to check that data is not longer than 144 bytes.</li>
<li>data_pad_reversed := BYTE_REVERSE(data_with_padding); -- is obtained from data_with_padding by reversing the byte order.</li>
<li>a random 32-byte temp_key is generated.</li>
<li>data_with_hash := data_pad_reversed + SHA256(temp_key + data_with_padding); -- after this assignment, data_with_hash is exactly 224 bytes long.</li>
<li>aes_encrypted := AES256_IGE(data_with_hash, temp_key, 0); -- AES256-IGE encryption with zero IV.</li>
<li>temp_key_xor := temp_key XOR SHA256(aes_encrypted); -- adjusted key, 32 bytes</li>
<li>key_aes_encrypted := temp_key_xor + aes_encrypted; -- exactly 256 bytes (2048 bits) long</li>
<li>The value of key_aes_encrypted is compared with the RSA-modulus of server_pubkey as a big-endian 2048-bit (256-byte) unsigned integer. If key_aes_encrypted turns out to be greater than or equal to the RSA modulus, the previous steps starting from the generation of new random temp_key are repeated. Otherwise the final step is performed:</li>
<li>encrypted_data := RSA(key_aes_encrypted, server_pubkey); --  256-byte big-endian integer is elevated to the requisite power from the RSA public key modulo the RSA modulus, and the result is stored as a big-endian integer consisting of exactly 256 bytes (with leading zero bytes if required).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>If the query is incorrect, the server returns a <code>-404</code> error and the handshake must be restarted (any subsequent request also returns <code>-404</code>, even if it is correct).<br>
A <code>-444</code> error may also be returned if a test DC ID is passed in <code>p_q_inner_data_(_temp)dc</code> when handshaking with a production DC, and vice versa.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, encrypted_answer is obtained as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>new_nonce_hash := 128 lower-order bits of SHA1 (new_nonce);</li>
<li>answer := serialization <pre><code>server_DH_inner_data#b5890dba nonce:int128 server_nonce:int128 g:int dh_prime:string g_a:string server_time:int = Server_DH_inner_data;</code></pre>
</li>
<li>answer_with_hash := SHA1(answer) + answer + (0-15 random bytes); such that the length be divisible by 16;</li>
<li>tmp_aes_key := SHA1(new_nonce + server_nonce) + substr (SHA1(server_nonce + new_nonce), 0, 12);</li>
<li>tmp_aes_iv := substr (SHA1(server_nonce + new_nonce), 12, 8) + SHA1(new_nonce + new_nonce) + substr (new_nonce, 0, 4);</li>
<li>encrypted_answer := AES256_ige_encrypt (answer_with_hash, tmp_aes_key, tmp_aes_iv); here, tmp_aes_key is a 256-bit key, and  tmp_aes_iv is a 256-bit initialization vector. The same as in all the other instances that use AES encryption, the encrypted data is padded with random bytes to a length divisible by 16 immediately prior to encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following this step, new_nonce is still known to client and server only. The client is certain that it is the server that responded and that the response was generated specifically in response to client query req_DH_params, since the response data are encrypted using new_nonce.</p>
<p>Client is expected to check whether <strong>p = dh_prime</strong> is a safe 2048-bit prime (meaning that both <strong>p</strong> and <strong>(p-1)/2</strong> are prime, and that 2^2047 &lt; p &lt; 2^2048), and that <strong>g</strong> generates a cyclic subgroup of prime order <strong>(p-1)/2</strong>, i.e. is a quadratic residue <strong>mod p</strong>. Since <strong>g</strong> is always equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, this is easily done using quadratic reciprocity law, yielding a simple condition on <strong>p mod 4g</strong> -- namely, <strong>p mod 8 = 7</strong> for <strong>g = 2</strong>; <strong>p mod 3 = 2</strong> for <strong>g = 3</strong>; no extra condition for <strong>g = 4</strong>; <strong>p mod 5 = 1 or 4</strong> for <strong>g = 5</strong>; <strong>p mod 24 = 19 or 23</strong> for <strong>g = 6</strong>; and <strong>p mod 7 = 3, 5 or 6</strong> for <strong>g = 7</strong>. After <strong>g</strong> and <strong>p</strong> have been checked by the client, it makes sense to cache the result, so as not to repeat lengthy computations in future.</p>
<p>If the verification takes too long time (which is the case for older mobile devices), one might initially run only 15 Miller--Rabin iterations for verifying primeness of <strong>p</strong> and <strong>(p - 1)/2</strong> with error probability not exceeding one billionth, and do more iterations later in the background.</p>
<p>Another optimization is to embed into the client application code a small table with some known "good" couples <strong>(g,p)</strong> (or just known safe primes <strong>p</strong>, since the condition on <strong>g</strong> is easily verified during execution), checked during code generation phase, so as to avoid doing such verification during runtime altogether. Server changes these values rarely, thus one usually has to put the current value of server's <strong>dh_prime</strong> into such a table. For example, current value of <strong>dh_prime</strong> equals (in big-endian byte order)</p>

In the first case, the client and the server have negotiated auth_key, following which they forget all other temporary data, and the client creates another encrypted session using auth_key. At the same time, server_salt is initially set to <code>substr(new_nonce, 0, 8) XOR substr(server_nonce, 0, 8)</code>. If required, the client stores the difference between server_time received in 5) and its local time, to be able always to have a good approximation of server time which is required to generate correct message identifiers.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Apart from the conditions on the Diffie-Hellman prime <strong>dh_prime</strong> and generator <strong>g</strong>, both sides are to check that <strong>g</strong>, <strong>g_a</strong> and <strong>g_b</strong> are greater than <strong>1</strong> and less than <strong>dh_prime - 1</strong>. We recommend checking that <strong>g_a</strong> and <strong>g_b</strong> are between <strong>2^{2048-64}</strong> and <strong>dh_prime - 2^{2048-64}</strong> as well.</p>

<p>If the client fails to receive any response to its query from the server within a certain time interval, it may simply re-send the query. If the server has already sent a response to this query (<em>exactly</em> the same request and not just similar: all the parameters during the repeat request must take on the same values) but it did not get to the client, the server will simply re-send the same response.
