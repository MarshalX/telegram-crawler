  <h1 id="dev_page_title">Telegram Bot Platform Developer Terms of Service</h1>
  
  <div id="dev_page_content"><p>Bots and Mini Apps (collectively, “<strong>Third Party Apps</strong>” or “<strong>TPA</strong>”) are third party applications that integrate into Telegram and its interfaces, allowing developers to offer tools, products and services through the Telegram ecosystem, which users may access using Telegram clients.</p>
<p>Developers can operate their TPA by interfacing with the Bot API (“<strong>Bot API</strong>”) made available by Telegram for this purpose. The Bot API, along with Bot and Mini App in-app native interfaces and integrations, and all other associated tools, documentation, frameworks and services made available by Telegram collectively comprise the Telegram Bot Platform (“<strong>Bot Platform</strong>”).</p>
<p>These Terms of Service for Bot Platform Developers (“<strong>Bot Developer Terms</strong>” or “<strong>these terms</strong>”) govern your usage of the Telegram Bot Platform for the purposes of developing services that integrate it or function in connection with it, and constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Telegram Messenger Inc. (“<strong>Telegram</strong>”). For the purposes of these Terms, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to Telegram, and ‘you’ refers to you, the developer of TPA.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="1-acceptance-of-bot-platform-developer-terms" href="#1-acceptance-of-bot-platform-developer-terms"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>1. Acceptance of Bot Platform Developer Terms</h3>
<p>By connecting your services to Telegram via Bot Platform, you agree that you have read in full, understood and accepted to be legally bound by the terms contained herein, in addition to the <a href="https://telegram.org/tos">Telegram Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy">Telegram Privacy Policy</a>. All of the aforementioned terms may be amended from time to time at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>For clarity, your continued access to and use of Bot Platform, including the continued operation of any TPA owned by you, shall constitute your acceptance of these Bot Developer Terms and all other terms that are incorporated herein, including any updates or modifications to them from time to time.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="2-scope" href="#2-scope"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2. Scope</h3>
<p>Developers can make their products and services accessible in Telegram apps by building TPA and connecting them to the Telegram platform via Bot API. TPA are hosted on their developers’ own servers, and are third-party services that Telegram allows to have a presence in Telegram apps, provided they comply with the <a href="https://telegram.org/tos">Terms of Service for Telegram</a>, these terms, and any other applicable agreements. Telegram has no affiliation with or connection to any TPA or TPA developers, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>Accordingly, you understand and acknowledge that all TPA are operated by third parties, unless otherwise stated by Telegram as the case may be. Some TPA may have a verified status in Telegram apps. This status is assigned at Telegram’s sole discretion and serves solely to help distinguish authentic and official bots from other similar bots or imitators; the status does not represent any form of endorsement of the TPA, its owner or the content it uploads.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="2-1-independent-participation" href="#2-1-independent-participation"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2.1. Independent Participation</h4>
<p>You understand and agree that your association with us is exclusively as a user of our services, functioning as an independent entity. These terms and your engagement with Bot Platform do not establish any form of agency, partnership, employment or joint venture between you and Telegram. You are expressly forbidden from representing yourself as anything other than an independent third-party as it pertains to your engagement with Bot Platform and, by extension, with Telegram.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="3-availability" href="#3-availability"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>3. Availability</h3>
<p>Bot Platform, some of its features, as well as individual TPA may not be available to certain users (both as users of TPA services and as developers), on certain Telegram clients or within certain geographical regions, in accordance with current demand, technological limitations, economic considerations, regulatory restrictions and other factors.</p>
<p>Consequently, you acknowledge and agree that the availability of Bot Platform, and, by extension, access to the creation, operation and usage of TPA or some of their features for both you and your TPA users may change at any time, and we are not obligated to provide advance notice, compensation or explanations for any such changes.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="4-privacy" href="#4-privacy"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4. Privacy</h3>
<p>Telegram only stores the data it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service, and your TPA are required to do the same. Furthermore, without limiting the stipulations set out in <a href="#8-compliance-with-laws">Section 8</a>, you hereby agree to strictly comply with all privacy laws and regulations that are applicable for you and for the users of your TPA. In any case, all data you obtain through or in connection with Bot Platform must be stored and handled strictly in compliance with the stipulations articulated in the <a href="/tos">Telegram Terms of Service</a>, the <a href="/privacy">Telegram Privacy Policy</a>, applicable legal and regulatory frameworks, developer guidelines from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#legal">Apple</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10144311">Google</a>, and these terms.</p>
<p>In compliance with the aforementioned terms, all TPA must be bound by a privacy policy that is easily accessible to their users, detailing what data they store, how they collect it, and for what purpose. </p>
<p>To aid developers in providing a functional and comprehensive privacy policy to their users, Telegram maintains a <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy-tpa">Standard Privacy Policy for Bots and Mini Apps</a>. This Standard Policy applies by default to all TPA that don’t provide a privacy policy of their own, with the understanding that it is written to be generally applicable to a wide range of services and jurisdictions. If you choose to adopt the Standard Policy by not providing one of your own, it is solely your responsibility to ensure that its stipulations are comprehensive, fit your use case in practice, and comply with all applicable laws.</p>
<p>If the Standard Policy does not properly detail the ways in which you collect, process and use personal data, or if your TPA provides services that are fully or partially incompatible with one or more of the stipulations therein, you <strong>must provide</strong> a separate privacy policy that is easily accessible to your users. In such cases, TPAs must set up a Privacy Policy in <a href="https://t.me/botfather">@BotFather</a> – furnishing all relevant privacy information and policies. All Mini Apps will automatically display a <em>Privacy Policy</em> button in their Settings page – as a shortcut to the respective privacy policy for apps that registered one and to our <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy-tpa">Standard Policy</a> for those that did not. Note that in all cases, if a TPA provides its own privacy policy, said policy will take precedence and the Standard Policy shall not apply.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, the privacy policy of your TPA cannot conflict, amend or exhibit any discrepancies with the stipulations of these Terms. Should any inconsistency arise, these Terms and the <a href="/privacy">Telegram Privacy Policy</a> will prevail. TPA which mishandle user data or otherwise violate their own privacy policy will be terminated from Bot Platform and legal action may be taken against their developers. Note that this includes but is not limited to those that are bound by the <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy-tpa">Standard Privacy Policy for Bots and Mini Apps</a> but do not comply with it in practice.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-1-what-data-we-share-with-you" href="#4-1-what-data-we-share-with-you"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.1. What data we share with you</h4>
<p>The data your TPA may receive as part of their standard operation within Telegram is listed in our <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#6-bot-messages">Privacy Policy</a>, see <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#6-3-what-data-bots-receive">6.3. What Data Bots Receive</a>.</p>
<p>You may request additional data from your users at your and their discretion, as agreed between you and them. However, you are strictly prohibited from attempting to deceive or mislead users with the purpose of evading or partially circumventing the limitations and protections that Telegram has established concerning the data you may access.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-2-data-storage-and-retention" href="#4-2-data-storage-and-retention"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.2. Data Storage and Retention</h4>
<p>Without limiting <a href="#4-privacy">Sections 4</a> and <a href="#9-termination">9</a>, and except as expressly required by applicable law, Telegram imposes certain obligations regarding the degree to which you may continue to retain user data over time. You acknowledge and agree that failing to comply with any such obligation may lead to the immediate termination of your account, your TPA, or both. Namely, insofar as you are allowed to do so under applicable law, you must, without undue delay:</p>
<p>(a) Delete user data upon their (or our, as the case may be) request that you do so;<br>(b) Delete user data when retention thereof becomes unnecessary to operate your TPA or to fulfill any other obligation as the case may be and as expressly agreed between you and your users;<br>(c) Delete all user data obtained through or in connection with Bot Platform upon the cessation of your TPA&#39;s operations therein, except for data that users have expressly agreed can be retained, which may be kept until such agreement remains in effect;<br>(d) Delete all user data obtained through or in connection with Bot Platform in response to a lawful request from an authorized legal entity;</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-3-data-scraping" href="#4-3-data-scraping"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.3. Data Scraping</h4>
<p>You agree not to use your TPA to collect, store, aggregate or process data beyond what is essential for the operation of your services. Always prohibited uses include any form of data collection aimed at creating large datasets, machine learning models and AI products, such as scraping public group or channel contents.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, you are free to use data submitted directly and voluntarily to your TPA by users, provided that you clearly inform them of the data&#39;s intended use and they give their individual, explicit, active and revocable consent.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-4-best-security-practices" href="#4-4-best-security-practices"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.4. Best Security Practices</h4>
<p>You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to employ all reasonable efforts to protect any data you receive from or in connection with Bot Platform, and to engage with it securely, having read and understood the associated official documentation.</p>
<p>At a minimum, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Make sure user data is always encrypted at rest and stored separately from its encryption key;</li>
<li>(b) Alert your users of any data breach you sustained, in accordance with applicable laws;</li>
<li>(c) Operate your TPA in a reasonably secure environment, having done due diligence in vetting the equipment, systems, hardware (if applicable), libraries and tools used to deploy and operate your software;</li>
<li>(d) Make all efforts to immediately remediate any data leak, security breach or significant malfunction that may potentially put the privacy or security of users at risk;</li>
<li>(e) Employ all required security checks, as applicable and as documented, when engaging with Bot Platform features that require them (e.g., <a href="https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login#receiving-authorization-data">Login Widgets Auth Data</a>)</li>
<li>(d) Take reasonable efforts to protect your TPA from malicious clients, researching and understanding what impact they may have (e.g., <a href="WebAppData">Arbitrary Data in WebAppData</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, you understand and agree that Telegram employs every effort to mitigate all security risks for its users, but will not be liable for any damages, losses or privacy breaches they may incur as a result of your negligence or inability to follow best security practices, including but not limited to the non-exhaustive list of requirements set out above.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-5-credentials" href="#4-5-credentials"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.5. Credentials</h4>
<p>To access Bot Platform and other Telegram APIs or tools, Telegram may provide some confidential credentials to you, such as an API ID, hash, secure tokens, and other necessary credentials as the case may be. These credentials are intended solely for the operation of the products and services you offer through Telegram APIs, and, without limiting the foregoing, you are explicitly prohibited from making them available to the public. You understand and agree that any actions taken by others who authenticate using your credentials will be deemed as taken by you, regardless of how they gained possession of the credentials.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="5-code-of-conduct" href="#5-code-of-conduct"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>5. Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>The following details the fundamental operating requirements of TPA on the Telegram platform. In addition to the stipulations below, you also agree to use Bot Platform in good faith, for the benefit of its users and to enrich the overall Telegram ecosystem. Failing to do so may result in restrictions on or termination of your participation in Bot Platform, as well as of your accounts in Telegram apps.</p>
<p>Additional local laws and regulations may apply to your TPA. It is your responsibility to ensure that your TPA complies with all applicable legislation therein, and Telegram will not be liable for any violations or actions on behalf of your TPA.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="5-1-content" href="#5-1-content"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>5.1. Content</h4>
<p>The content hosted on your TPA must comply with the <a href="https://telegram.org/tos">Telegram Terms of Service</a>. You are responsible for any content uploaded by your TPA, including the moderation of user-generated content that is accessible via your TPA, and agree that Telegram may also intervene to moderate content hosted by your TPA, but is not obligated to do so.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="5-2-operation" href="#5-2-operation"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>5.2. Operation</h4>
<p>You understand and agree that your TPA must operate fully within the bounds of the rules set out below at all times. Should Telegram in its sole discretion determine that your TPA did not operate well within these guidelines at any point in time, it may terminate your TPA, your account, or both. Furthermore, violators may face legal consequences pursuant to relevant laws and regulations they undermined. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Any communication, actions, provided services or functions of your TPA must comply with the Telegram Terms of Service;</li>
<li>(b) Your TPA must not harass or spam users with unsolicited messages;</li>
<li>(c) You and your TPA (including its name, username and branding) must not impersonate (both explicitly and implicitly or by association) Telegram or any entity which did not authorize you to represent them;</li>
<li>(d) Your TPA (including its name, username and branding) must not misrepresent the services or functions it provides, including but not limited to misleading users into performing certain actions in the pursuit of an unachievable outcome. Without limiting the foregoing and by way of example, the following use cases are forbidden<ul>
<li>(i) MLM or ponzi schemes</li>
<li>(ii) Social growth manipulation</li>
<li>(iii) Deceptive practices to collect personal information (i.e., phishing scams)</li>
<li>(iv) Asking users for their Telegram password or OTP</li>
<li>(v) Misrepresenting an illegal product as legally purchasable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(e) You must not leverage your TPA and, by extension, Bot Platform in conjunction with external interfaces (i.e., frontends), frameworks or tools, to develop external services or applications that diverge significantly from the intended use cases of Bot Platform (e.g., cloud storage sites).</li>
<li>(f) Your TPA must not attempt to circumvent or otherwise undermine Telegram rate limits and moderation. Without limiting the foregoing and by way of example, your TPA must not operate by proxy (i.e., using Bot API credentials supplied by other users) in an attempt to circumvent bans or content moderation. </li>
<li>(g) Your TPA must not be used to distribute (or itself be part of) malware or other harmful software or content;</li>
<li>(h) Your TPA must not be used to provide, link to, aggregate, host, index, distribute, lend out, exchange, trade, rent, sell or facilitate the sale of illegal, pirated, regulated or questionable goods and services.</li>
<li>(i) Your TPA must not upload, promote or facilitate the spread of violence, hate speech, harassment, violent threats, personal information or media belonging to unconsenting third parties and similar content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, you understand and agree that your TPA must behave in a reasonably predictable manner at all times. That is, it cannot use its privileges (moderation permissions, private chat management via Telegram Business, etc.) to carry out actions that diverge from the purposes under which the privileges were originally obtained. For clarity, this means that users must always be informed of any significant changes pertaining to the operational scope of your TPA, and should be given an option to opt out of these changes.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="5-3-interface" href="#5-3-interface"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>5.3. Interface</h4>
<p>The interface of your TPA should ideally be complementary to that of Telegram apps, and Bot Platform provides several components that facilitate this. In any case, your TPA must always ensure that interface elements are functional (e.g., flyouts and pop-up windows can be closed, etc.) and do not intrude or obstruct the user’s ability to perform actions within Telegram apps. Similarly, you are prohibited from altering or misrepresenting any component or dialog of your TPA interface to falsely appear as notifications or alerts originating from Telegram, the user’s operating system or browser, or any third parties who have not granted you authorization to represent them.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="5-4-telegram-business" href="#5-4-telegram-business"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>5.4. Telegram Business</h4>
<p>Telegram Business subscribers may choose to connect a Telegram Bot to their account at their discretion, to streamline the process of managing and possibly replying to incoming messages in a subset of private chats of their choosing.</p>
<p>If your TPA supports being designated as a Chatbot under Telegram Business, without limiting the Terms set out in this agreement, you additionally agree to:</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) Clearly and truthfully represent the full extent of the services provided by your bot through Telegram Business;</li>
<li>(ii) If applicable and without limiting 4.2., clearly state what private user data you will retain, how long you will store it and for what purpose;</li>
<li>(iii) Never use message contents, files or other data you obtained or processed through Telegram Business for any other purpose than providing your services as a business Chatbot;</li>
<li>(iv) Without limiting 4.2., never disclose message contents, files or other data you obtained or processed through or in connection with Telegram Business to third parties (including third-party APIs) without the user&#39;s authorization;</li>
<li>(v) Never attempt to conceal any activity carried out by your TPA from the business account owner;</li>
<li>(vi) Promptly notify your business users of any significant changes to your TPA and how they operate, enabling them to make the informed choice of opting out;</li>
</ul>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, you understand and agree that violating any of the aforementioned obligations may lead to the immediate and permanent ban of your TPA and your account from the Telegram platform, as well as legal action taken against you, your associates, and those acting on your behalf as the case may be.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="6-payments" href="#6-payments"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6. Payments</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="6-1-physical-goods-and-services" href="#6-1-physical-goods-and-services"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.1. Physical Goods and Services</h4>
<p>Telegram does not process payments for physical goods and services. Instead, Bot Platform provides a set of APIs that allow developers to interface solely and directly with third-party payment providers for the purposes of receiving payments. For clarity, neither Telegram nor Bot Platform oversee, verify, guarantee, or process payments and financial transactions between you and users of your TPA. Additionally, we neither hold nor have custody of TPA users&#39; funds at any point before, during and after transactions between you and them, and we do not act as a financial intermediary in any capacity.</p>
<p>Accordingly and without limiting Section 8, if you wish to sell physical goods and services on Telegram, you can choose a third-party payment provider at your discretion and according to their availability in your regions of interest.</p>
<h5><a class="anchor" name="6-1-1-payment-information" href="#6-1-1-payment-information"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.1.1. Payment Information</h5>
<p>Telegram does not store credit card details for purchases made via TPA. Such data is handled solely by third-party payment providers. See our <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#7-third-party-payment-services">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>
<h5><a class="anchor" name="6-1-2-payment-providers" href="#6-1-2-payment-providers"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.1.2. Payment Providers</h5>
<p>Third-party payment providers may have additional terms and stipulations regarding their use in connection with your TPA, as agreed between you and them. Should Telegram alter Bot Platform in such a way that affects your or your TPA&#39;s ability to interface with a third-party payment provider in any capacity, or should the provider itself cease operations or become unavailable to you for any reason, it is your responsibility to settle any resulting disputes, unclaimed funds, potential losses or other adverse consequences as the case may be, in accordance with the provider’s terms.</p>
<p>For clarity, it is solely your responsibility to fully understand and comply with the terms, conditions, and policies set forth by any third-party payment provider you choose to use in conjunction with your TPA, and any issues or disputes arising thereunder are to be resolved solely between you and them.</p>
<h5><a class="anchor" name="6-1-3-payment-disputes-for-physical-goods-and-services" href="#6-1-3-payment-disputes-for-physical-goods-and-services"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.1.3. Payment Disputes for Physical Goods and Services</h5>
<p>Payments conducted or initiated through TPA in connection with the sale of physical goods and services are processed by a third-party payment provider, as agreed between you and the payment provider. </p>
<p>Telegram does not handle, manage, oversee, verify or provide any sort of warranty over such transactions. Consequently, you understand and agree that any disputes, claims, losses, misunderstandings, technical errors, or issues of any kind (both accidental and allegedly intentional) related to payments or transactions must be resolved between yourself, the purchaser and the respective payment provider, when applicable. Telegram bears no responsibility whatsoever and will not be a party to any payment-related disputes or discussions, nor is it liable for any losses or damages the parties involved may incur.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="6-2-digital-goods-and-services" href="#6-2-digital-goods-and-services"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.2. Digital Goods and Services</h4>
<p>Your TPA may also offer digital goods and services for purchase. Due to requirements from stores that host Telegram apps, transactions for digital goods and services cannot be processed through third-party payment providers. Accordingly, all transactions pertaining to digital goods and services must be executed exclusively through the exchange of <a href="https://telegram.org/tos/stars">Telegram Stars</a>, which can be procured by Telegram users through separate in-app purchases. </p>
<p>Since Telegram must adhere to Apple and Google’s definitions of <em>digital goods and services</em> (i.e., goods and services that must be sold via in-app purchases), which may change over time, you should reference the relevant documentation from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase">Apple</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738">Google</a> directly to ensure your offerings remain in line with the latest available guidelines.</p>
<p>If your TPA is found to be using alternative payment systems for digital goods and services, you may receive a notice to the Telegram account that owns your TPA. Should you fail to comply with such notices, we may have to make your TPA inaccessible from store versions of Telegram or terminate it from Bot Platform.</p>
<h5><a class="anchor" name="6-2-1-payment-disputes-for-digital-goods-and-services" href="#6-2-1-payment-disputes-for-digital-goods-and-services"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.2.1. Payment Disputes for Digital Goods and Services</h5>
<p>As the purveyor, it is your duty to ensure that the digital products and services in your TPA are delivered as advertised and in a timely manner, as agreed between you and the purchasers. If you are unable to fulfill a purchase, your bot is able to return the Stars to the purchaser in full via the relevant Telegram Bot API method, with no penalty.</p>
<p>Should a dispute arise concerning any transactions involving digital goods and services sold by your TPA, it is your responsibility to address and rectify the situation. For that reason, all TPA must be able to respond to the command <code>/paysupport</code> and process user requests regarding payment issues. Telegram has no obligation to mediate or be a party to any such disputes between you, the user and any involved third parties. Likewise, you understand and agree that Telegram is not responsible for refund claims initiated via third-parties, including but not limited to third-party payment processors, financial institutions, credit card issuers, the App Store, Google Play and any other similar provider or intermediary. For clarity, all conflicts and claims must be resolved independently by the parties involved, without recourse to Telegram, which hereby disclaims, and you agree to indemnify from, all liability related to such matters. </p>
<p>Should a payment dispute result in a refund for the purchaser, you, the purveyor, will be responsible for the funds returned to the purchaser, which will be deducted from your TPA’s balance. Accordingly, Telegram expressly discourages the real-time sale of digital products, virtual items and digital services which hold inherent value and cannot be reclaimed, frozen, rescinded, invalidated or suspended following a successful dispute or chargeback by the purchaser.</p>
<p>Note that your failure to rectify legitimate disputes, as shown by credible reports from users and ultimately at Telegram’s sole discretion, may lead to limitations or penalties being placed on your TPA and your Telegram account. These include, but are not limited to, Stars being debited from your Star balance, permanent removal of your TPA from Bot Platform or from store versions of Telegram, a public <em>SCAM</em> label displayed on your TPA and the termination of your Telegram account.</p>
<h5><a class="anchor" name="6-2-2-tpa-balance" href="#6-2-2-tpa-balance"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.2.2. TPA Balance</h5>
<p>Telegram Stars earned by your TPA are displayed in a balance which you can access from the Telegram account that owns your TPA. Telegram Stars displayed in your balance do not constitute your property, Telegram allows you to receive them in exchange for digital goods and services, but you have no license or title to them except as explicitly set out in these terms. You understand and agree that Telegram is not a financial institution and does not act as a custodian of your funds.</p>
<p>Stars on your TPA’s balance can be used to place Telegram Ads for your TPA (<a href="https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers#6-2-3-advertising-with-stars">see 6.2.3. below</a>), to increase messaging limits (<a href="https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers#6-2-5-paid-broadcasts-with-stars">see 6.2.5.</a>) or to accept rewards (<a href="https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers#6-2-4-rewards-for-stars">see 6.2.4.</a>). Confirming such actions will debit Telegram Stars from your TPA&#39;s balance accordingly. Stars on your TPA’s balance are owned by Telegram and have no inherent value beyond our good-faith commitment to advertisement credits and rewards based on the value Telegram assigns to each Star.</p>
<h5><a class="anchor" name="6-2-3-advertising-with-stars" href="#6-2-3-advertising-with-stars"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.2.3. Advertising with Stars</h5>
<p>You can use Stars earned by your TPA to place Telegram advertisements for that specific TPA, provided that the contents it hosts or displays, along with the name and branding of the TPA itself are in compliance with the <a href="https://ads.telegram.org/guidelines">Telegram Ad Policies and Guidelines</a>. You understand and agree that by placing Telegram Ads for your TPA you are further subject to the <a href="https://ads.telegram.org/tos">Telegram Ad Platform Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>When used for <a href="https://ads.telegram.org/">Telegram Ads</a>, each Star in your balance is worth 0.02 USD in advertising credit. It is possible that this value may fluctuate, based on temporary promotions and incentives, or to address market conditions, economic factors and other events.</p>
<!-- 
> **Note**: Star-based advertising interfaces will become available in official Telegram apps by **July 2024**.

<h5><a class="anchor" name="6-2-4-rewards-for-stars" href="#6-2-4-rewards-for-stars"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.2.4. Rewards for Stars</h5>
<p>Developers can receive an equivalent of 0.013 USD worth of rewards for each Telegram Star.</p>
<p>Telegram determines the monetary value it assigns to Stars in its sole discretion, and this value has no connection, direct or implied, to the historical, present, or anticipated future purchase cost of Stars in any particular region. You acknowledge that both the Star purchase cost and the monetary value Telegram assigns to them for the purposes of rewards may fluctuate over time, based on current market conditions, economic considerations and other factors. We do not anticipate frequent changes to the monetary value assigned to Stars for the purpose of issuing rewards. </p>
<p>By offering purchases with Stars in your TPA, you understand and agree that Telegram retains the right to temporarily withhold or permanently debit Stars from your balance in response to user refunds of in-app purchases, suspected abuse of Bot Platform, or violation of these Terms, the Telegram <a href="https://telegram.org/tos">Terms of Service</a> or any other terms which govern your TPA, including applicable third-party store terms as the case may be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For technical reasons, Stars in your balance may not become available for advertising credits or rewards for up to <strong>21 days after</strong> their receipt.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5><a class="anchor" name="6-2-4-1-receiving-rewards" href="#6-2-4-1-receiving-rewards"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.2.4.1. Receiving Rewards</h5>
<p>Telegram currently outsources the processing of rewards to <a href="https://fragment.com/">Fragment</a>, a platform owned and operated by Fragment Corp. You understand and agree that your engagement with Fragment is further subject to the Fragment <a href="https://fragment.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://fragment.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Fragment may be unable to issue rewards for certain users or in certain countries, in accordance with regulatory considerations and other factors. Likewise, your government, internet service provider or other relevant authorities may directly or indirectly prevent you from accessing or engaging with Telegram, Telegram Stars or Fragment. All aforementioned factors are outside of our control, therefore, should you for any reason be unable to engage with Fragment, receive rewards, or otherwise ultimately benefit from Stars in the way you had anticipated when initiating sales or accepting rewards, you understand and agree that Telegram will not be liable, nor will it offer any alternative compensation, refund or reward.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="6-2-5-broadcasting-messages-with-stars" href="#6-2-5-broadcasting-messages-with-stars"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.2.5. Broadcasting Messages with Stars</h4>
<p>By default, TPA are able to broadcast up to 30 messages per second to users who have granted permission to contact them, free of charge. Developers who wish to broadcast more than 30 messages per second can enable increased message limits for their TPA via <a href="https://t.me/botfather">@Botfather</a> on Telegram, allowing it to optionally broadcast up to 1000 messages per second.</p>
<p>Each message successfully broadcasted over the free threshold of 30 messages per second incurs a non-refundable fee of 0.1 Stars, paid with Telegram Stars from the TPA&#39;s balance. In order to enable this feature, a TPA must have at least 100,000 Stars on its balance and at least 100,000 monthly active users, as determined by Telegram.</p>
<p>Without limiting Section 5, developers who enable increased message limits must ensure that their broadcasts are strictly conducted in good faith, for legitimate business purposes or in furtherance of legitimate interests that enhance user experience or meaningfully enrich the respective TPA&#39;s functionality. It is expressly prohibited to exploit increased limits to spam or harass users in any capacity.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="6-2-6-expiration" href="#6-2-6-expiration"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.2.6. Expiration</h4>
<p>Stars earned by your TPA are valid for 3 years from the date they were received. Should you fail to accept rewards or place Telegram advertisements with the Stars you accrued within their 3 year period of validity, they will be considered forfeit and debited from your balance.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="6-3-account-management" href="#6-3-account-management"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.3. Account Management</h4>
<p>By using or offering your TPA as a means of storing, handling or processing financial assets (including cryptocurrency), you accept that it is your responsibility to ensure that any assets, credentials or other information is stored securely. This responsibility extends to the Telegram account that owns the TPA credentials, as provided by <a href="https://t.me/botfather">@BotFather</a> on Telegram. You understand and agree that if you delete, compromise or otherwise lose access to said account for any reason, all TPA it created may be terminated at any time, and any Telegram Stars stored therein will become inaccessible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you understand that Telegram may delete or make inaccessible whole chats, messages, media and files sent to and from your TPA at any time. In general, Telegram makes no guarantee that any data it stores in connection with your TPA, including but not limited to key-value pairs in the Telegram Cloud Storage for Bots and Mini Apps, will remain available, uncorrupted or fit for any particular purpose. </p>
<p>Therefore, you are expected to design your application and its persistence paradigms in a manner that effectively nullifies the impact of partially or fully losing any data that is typically provided by Bot Platform. Similarly, you should not assume that the availability of any such data from Telegram will be perpetual or for a specific duration, even if otherwise stated in the relevant documentation or source code. Accordingly, you expressly understand and agree that losses incurred by either you or your TPA users in connection with or as a result of your failure to properly secure relevant data or credentials will be solely your responsibility, and Telegram will neither be liable nor compensate you, your associates, those acting on your behalf or your TPA users for this loss.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="6-4-taxes" href="#6-4-taxes"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.4. Taxes</h4>
<p>You are solely responsible for all taxes and fees associated with any income you receive via any services, products, content, or utilities created by you through or in connection with Bot Platform, if applicable and in accordance with local laws. Telegram will not inform you of, nor calculate or pay out any taxes and fees on your behalf. For clarity, this applies both to payments initiated through the Telegram Payment API for TPA, Telegram Stars, and any other payment framework or processor you may choose to use.</p>
<p>Consequently, you explicitly acknowledge and agree that Telegram will not be liable for any fees, expenses, penalties, or additional costs you may incur as a result of your participation in Bot Platform, including but not limited to those arising from your failure to properly comply with applicable local laws and tax regulations.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="7-blockchain-integration" href="#7-blockchain-integration"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7. Blockchain Integration</h3>
<p>To maintain a highly scalable, smooth and secure user experience in line with Telegram&#39;s standards, all <strong>Mini Apps</strong> which implement cryptocurrency functionality, either within the Mini App itself or within its connected bot, are required to be based exclusively on <a href="https://ton.org/">The Open Network (TON)</a> blockchain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For specific examples of services that are permitted or not permitted by these terms, reference our <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/blockchain-guidelines">blockchain guidelines</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="7-1-issuing-assets" href="#7-1-issuing-assets"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.1. Issuing Assets</h4>
<p>If your Mini App integrates functionality related to the generation or distribution of cryptocurrency tokens or blockchain assets, it must exclusively use <a href="https://ton.org/">The Open Network (TON)</a> blockchain for the creation and distribution of said tokens or assets.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="7-2-connecting-wallets" href="#7-2-connecting-wallets"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.2. Connecting Wallets</h4>
<p>Any Mini App that utilizes functionality related to cryptocurrency wallets must only interface with wallets connected via the <a href="https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/overview">TON Connect SDK</a>. This includes, but is not limited to, user authorization and signing of blockchain transactions, as well as the sending and receipt of any cryptocurrency tokens or blockchain assets. </p>
<p>For clarity, this applies both to Mini Apps that directly integrate cryptocurrency wallets and those that indirectly interact with cryptocurrency wallets in any capacity. Using other wallet connection protocols is permitted for the purpose of enabling users to bridge assets from other blockchains.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="7-3-multichain-wallets" href="#7-3-multichain-wallets"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.3. Multichain Wallets</h4>
<p>Mini Apps that function as multichain wallets, whether they be custodial or non-custodial, are permitted to let users manage assets on other blockchains, provided that such actions are performed directly within the interface of the Mini App. If available, any interactions with other apps and platforms must exclusively be carried out via <a href="https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/overview">TON Connect</a>.</p>
<p>For clarity, this includes interactions with other Mini Apps and external apps, as well as embedded catalogs within Mini Apps and external apps.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="7-4-promotion" href="#7-4-promotion"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.4. Promotion</h4>
<p>Mini Apps are prohibited from directly or indirectly promoting cryptocurrency wallets, unless such wallets are based on the TON blockchain, exclusively use <a href="https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/overview">TON Connect</a> for interactions with apps, and primarily provide asset management for the TON Blockchain.</p>
<p>Mini Apps are prohibited from directly or indirectly promoting cryptoassets that are not based on TON.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mini Apps must not direct or link users (through any means) to external platforms, apps or websites where cryptoassets not based on TON are promoted or utilized.</p>
<p>For clarity, this includes but is not limited to any content, promotions and newsletters within the mini app itself, as well as its branding (e.g., description, logo, etc.), paid Telegram advertisements and announcements via Telegram channels or communities managed by or officially affiliated with the mini app.</p>
<p>Without limiting the above and <a href="https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers#6-2-digital-goods-and-services">Section 6.2.</a>, if your mini app issued a TON-based token that is listed on a licensed exchange, then you may direct users to that exchange, provided both your mini app and the exchange comply with all applicable regulations and these Terms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For specific examples of services that are permitted or not permitted by these terms, reference our <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/blockchain-guidelines">blockchain guidelines</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="7-5-grace-period" href="#7-5-grace-period"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.5. Grace Period</h4>
<p>To maintain uninterrupted access for Telegram users to their Mini Apps, developers must ensure compliance with the clauses 7.1–7.4 above by <strong>February 1, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Existing Mini Apps operating on other blockchains must transition to TON by <strong>February 21, 2025</strong>, including bridging existing assets, migrating smart contracts, and exclusively utilizing TON Connect.</p>
<p>The grace period <strong>does not apply</strong> to launching any blockchain-based initiatives, including but not limited to issuing new blockchain-based assets and starting to distribute blockchain-based assets. All assets issued or distributed on or after <strong>January 21, 2025</strong> must adhere to <a href="#7-1-issuing-assets">clause 7.1</a> outlined above.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="8-2-marketing" href="#8-2-marketing"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>8.2. Marketing</h4>
<p>By accessing and utilizing Bot Platform, you consent to grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to utilize (not reproduce) your TPA for the betterment of the Telegram ecosystem. This encompasses the running, public displaying, advertising, distribution, hosting, enhancement, translation, and utilization of your TPA in manners that facilitate the functionality, publicity, popularity, advancement, and improvement of our platform, APIs, services and products.

<p>Should either Bot Platform or your TPA be discontinued, this license will remain in effect.</p>
<h5><a class="anchor" name="8-2-1-featured-mini-apps" href="#8-2-1-featured-mini-apps"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>8.2.1. Featured Mini Apps</h5>
