  <h1 id="dev_page_title">Terms of Service for Telegram Peer-to-Peer Login Program</h1>
  
  <div id="dev_page_content"><p>Users sign up and log in to Telegram by receiving a verification code, word or phrase (<strong>“OTP”</strong>) that is sent via SMS. These messages are sent via enterprise SMS operators that, depending on the region and other factors, have varying degrees of reliability. </p>
<p>To help ensure that users in all areas can reliably receive OTPs, Telegram offers a Peer-to-Peer Login Program (<strong>“P2PL”</strong>) that allows users of the direct <a href="/android">Telegram for Android</a> app (<strong>“Telegram App”</strong>) to volunteer their phone number as a relay for SMS login codes, words and phrases, in exchange for a Telegram Premium subscription.</p>
<p>These Terms govern your usage of the P2PL Program provided by Telegram Messenger Inc. <strong>(“Telegram”)</strong> and constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Telegram. For the purposes of these terms, <strong>‘we’</strong>, <strong>‘us’</strong> and <strong>‘our’</strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’</strong> refers to you, the user of the P2PL.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="1-acceptance-of-p2pl-terms" href="#1-acceptance-of-p2pl-terms"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>1. Acceptance of P2PL Terms</h3>
<p>By using P2PL, you agree that you have read in full, understood and accepted to be legally bound by the terms contained herein, in addition to <a href="/tos">Telegram’s Terms of Service</a>, <a href="/privacy">Telegram’s Privacy Policy</a> and<a href="https://telegram.org/tos#terms-of-service-for-telegram-premium"> Terms of Service for Telegram Premium</a>. All of the aforementioned terms may be amended from time to time without notice. You may further be subject to the Terms of Service of your third party mobile carrier, as agreed between you and the third party.</p>
<p>For clarity, your continued access to and use of P2PL shall constitute your acceptance of these Terms and all other terms that are incorporated herein, including any updates or modifications to them from time to time.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="2-scope" href="#2-scope"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2. Scope</h3>
<p>By joining the P2PL Program, you acknowledge and agree that Telegram may use your phone number as a relay for a maximum of 150 OTP SMS messages per month. You understand and agree that SMS messages sent from your number as part of the P2PL Program may incur charges from your mobile carrier or service provider. You expressly agree to bear any such charges, including but not limited to carrier rates, additional fees and any international SMS charges that may apply from time to time. For clarity, you acknowledge and agree that these expenses will be covered by you alone, and that Telegram will not provide a reimbursement at any point before, during or after your participation in P2PL. You further agree that you will not attempt to obstruct or otherwise interfere with the delivery of the aforementioned SMS in any manner. In consideration of your continued active participation in the P2PL Program, Telegram will reward you with a monthly Telegram Premium subscription each time you meet a quota of successfully sent SMS. You understand and agree that this quota may differ by country and is subject to change at any time without notice at our sole discretion.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="2-1-role" href="#2-1-role"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2.1 Role</h4>
<p>Acceptance of these terms and participation in P2PL is in no way to be viewed or represented as a form of employment or partnership with Telegram. Any attempt to impersonate Telegram staff or use your role in P2PL to contact, coerce or intimidate users will result in your immediate termination from P2PL.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="3-privacy" href="#3-privacy"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>3. Privacy</h3>
<p>The architecture of the P2PL Program facilitates the sending of OTPs, while taking great care to protect the privacy of its participants. However, Telegram cannot prevent the OTP recipient from seeing your phone number upon receiving your SMS. Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that you have considered any and all potential repercussions this may entail, and you have taken the necessary precautions to mitigate them as you see fit. Accordingly, you understand and agree that Telegram will not be liable for any inconvenience, harassment or harm resulting from unwanted, unauthorized or illegal actions undertaken by users who became aware of your phone number through P2PL.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="3-1-communication" href="#3-1-communication"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>3.1 Communication</h4>
<p>Conversely, you agree not to contact any OTP recipients outside the scope of your involvement in P2PL. You agree not to send any messages beyond the automated SMS codes, words and phrases generated by your Telegram App, even if the recipient replies to you.</p>
<p>At times, the OTP may consist of a word or a combination of words, which might prompt some recipients to accidentally respond. Should any recipient reply to your OTP SMS, you are expressly forbidden from replying further, including but not limited to attempts at explaining or clarifying the purpose of your initial message.</p>
<p>You also agree not to otherwise contact or communicate with recipients on any other platforms, including but not limited to Telegram. You acknowledge that sharing or divulging any personal information about recipients, including their phone number, will result in not only your termination from the P2PL program, but may also result in legal action to the extent allowed by applicable law.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="4-availability" href="#4-availability"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4. Availability</h3>
<p>The Telegram P2PL Program may not be available to users in certain regions in accordance with current demand, economic factors, relevant regulatory restrictions and local telecommunications infrastructure. You acknowledge and agree that P2PL availability may change at any time in your area, and we are not obligated to provide advance notice or explanation for such changes.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="5-cancellation" href="#5-cancellation"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>5. Cancellation</h3>
<p>Participants in P2PL may withdraw from the program at any time. Upon withdrawal, your phone number will be removed from relay services. Should you decide to uninstall or log out from Telegram App, that will be considered a formal withdrawal from the program.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="6-termination" href="#6-termination"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6. Termination</h3>
<p>Failure to comply with these Terms or the <a href="https://telegram.org/tos">Telegram Terms of Service</a> may result in a temporary or a permanent ban from Telegram or the P2PL Program. In such instances, your participation in the P2PL Program and your access to its Premium Services will be revoked. You will not be compensated for any losses resulting from your termination.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="6-1-unilateral-termination" href="#6-1-unilateral-termination"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.1. Unilateral Termination</h4>
<p>Telegram can decide to discontinue P2PL at any time, including in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control. We make no guarantee of ongoing or continued support for this program. In the event that the program is terminated, the Premium benefits of participants may continue to be accessible for some time, or immediately become unavailable, at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>By accepting these Terms, you agree that Telegram has complete discretion to terminate your reward from or participation in P2PL, without warning, for reasons that may or may not be outside your control. This includes but is not limited to poor performance, weak network connection, a lost or damaged SIM card, or a malfunctioning device. In such cases, Telegram may temporarily suspend your Premium reward until the situation improves, or permanently disconnect your phone number from the P2PL program.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="7-liability" href="#7-liability"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7. Liability</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Telegram shall bear no liability for any costs, expenses, damages, or any other adverse or otherwise unforeseen consequences that you may incur as a direct or indirect consequence of your present or past participation in the P2PL Program. </p>
<p>By accepting these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that you have conducted due diligence in verifying the compatibility of your mobile service plan with the requirements of the P2PL Program, and to ensure that all necessary arrangements are in place to facilitate your uninhibited participation therein, including but not limited to your mobile carrier Terms of Service, local laws and all other applicable regulation as the case may be.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you understand and agree that Telegram unequivocally disclaims, and you expressly absolve Telegram, of all liability in relation to disputes that may directly or indirectly arise from your engagement with P2PL, including but not limited to disputes with your Mobile carrier.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="7-1-indemnity" href="#7-1-indemnity"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.1. Indemnity</h4>
<p>You accept and agree to grant Telegram and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, contractors and employees absolute indemnity and to hold them harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, proceedings, obligations, investigations, demands, suits, expenses, costs and damages (including but not limited to legal fees, fines or penalties imposed by any authorities, private entities or regulatory institutions) arising from, related to, or in any way incurred as a result of your use of, conduct in connection with, your engagement with, receipt of and access to the P2PL Program. For clarity, this indemnity clause complements the rights, privileges and protections already provided to us under the Telegram Terms of Service (if applicable).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="8-premium-services" href="#8-premium-services"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>8. Premium Services</h3>
<p>The specific Premium Services included as part of your participation are governed by the <a href="https://telegram.org/tos#terms-of-service-for-telegram-premium">Terms of Service for Telegram Premium</a>. </p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="8-1-reward" href="#8-1-reward"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>8.1. Reward</h4>
<p>Your active participation in the P2PL program will be rewarded with a transferable gift code that grants access to a monthly Telegram Premium subscription. If you lose, give away or otherwise do not activate the code for any reason, you acknowledge and agree that you are doing so of your own will and at your own cost, and Telegram will not reimburse you.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="8-2-value" href="#8-2-value"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>8.2. Value</h4>
<p>The inclusion of Premium Services as a reward for participation in P2PL is in no way meant to estimate or give a relative monetary value for your enrollment in P2PL. We make no claim that the Premium Services you receive will be of greater or equal value than costs incurred from your participation. </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="9-changes" href="#9-changes"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>9. Changes</h3>
<p>We will review and may update these Terms from time to time. Any changes to these Terms will become effective when we post the revised P2PL Terms of Service on this page <strong><a href="https://telegram.org/tos/p2pl">www.telegram.org/tos/p2pl</a></strong>. Please check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Terms, an optional summary of which we may set out below.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="9-1-advance-notice" href="#9-1-advance-notice"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>9.1. Advance Notice</h4>
<p>We will give you no less than 30 days&#39; advance notice of any change in the P2PL SMS quota via a message to your Telegram account and you will have the opportunity to withdraw from the program before it comes into effect.</p>
