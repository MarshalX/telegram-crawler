<p>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free. You can use Telegram on all your devices <strong>at the same time</strong> — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers. Telegram is one of the <strong>top 5 most downloaded apps</strong> in the world with over <strong>1 billion</strong> active users. </p>
<p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and <a href="/blog/shared-files"><strong>files</strong></a> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to <strong>200,000</strong> people or <a href="/blog/channels">channels</a> for broadcasting to <strong>unlimited</strong> audiences. You can write to your phone contacts and find people by their <a href="#usernames-and-t-me"><strong>usernames</strong></a>. As a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs. In addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/calls"><strong>voice</strong></a> and <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-calls"><strong>video calls</strong></a>, as well as <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats"><strong>voice chats in groups</strong></a> for thousands of participants.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-who-is-telegram-for" href="#q-who-is-telegram-for"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Who is Telegram for?</h4>
<p>Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/calls">calls</a>. Business users and small teams may like the large groups, <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#usernames-and-t-me">usernames</a>, <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org">desktop apps</a> and powerful <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/shared-files">file sharing</a> options.</p>
<p>Since Telegram groups can have up to <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/replies-mentions-stickers">200,000 members</a>, we support <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/replies-mentions-hashtags">replies, mentions and hashtags</a> that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/replies-mentions-stickers">efficient</a>. You can appoint <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/admin-revolution">admins with advanced tools</a> to help these communities prosper in peace. <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/supergroups5k">Public groups</a> can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.</p>
<p>In case you&#39;re more into pictures, Telegram has animated <a href="/blog/gif-revolution">gif search</a>, a state of the art <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/photo-editor-and-passcodes">photo editor</a>, and an <a href="/blog/stickers-revolution">open sticker platform</a> (find some cool stickers <a href="https://t.me/durov/40">here</a> or <a href="https://t.me/sticker">here</a>). What&#39;s more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device. With Telegram&#39;s cloud support and <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/cache-and-stickers">cache management options</a>, Telegram can take up nearly <strong>zero</strong> space on your phone.</p>
<p>Those looking for extra privacy should check out our <a href="/blog/privacy-revolution">advanced settings</a> and rather revolutionary <a href="/privacy">policy</a>. And if you want secrecy, try our device-specific <a href="#secret-chats">Secret Chats</a> with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/photo-editor-and-passcodes">passcode</a>.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-is-telegram-different-from-whatsapp" href="#q-how-is-telegram-different-from-whatsapp"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?</h4>
<p>Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with <strong>seamless sync</strong>. As a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to <strong>2 GB</strong> <em>each</em>. </p>
<p>Telegram needs less than <strong>100 MB</strong> on your device – you can keep <strong>all your media</strong> in the cloud without deleting things – simply <a href="https://t.me/TelegramTips/206">clear your cache to free up space</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Telegram&#39;s multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, it is faster and way more <a href="#security">secure</a>. On top of that, private messaging on Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.</p>
<p>Telegram&#39;s API and code is open, and developers are welcome to create their own Telegram apps. We also have a <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots">Bot API</a>, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots">integrate any services</a>, and even <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/payments">accept payments</a> from users around the world. </p>
<p>And that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-old-is-telegram" href="#q-how-old-is-telegram"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How old is Telegram?</h4>
<p>Telegram for iOS was launched on <strong>August 14, 2013</strong>. The alpha version of Telegram for Android officially launched on October 20, 2013. More and more <a href="/apps">Telegram clients</a> appear, built by independent developers using Telegram&#39;s <a href="//core.telegram.org/api">open platform</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-which-devices-can-i-use" href="#q-which-devices-can-i-use"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Which devices can I use?</h4>
<p>You can use Telegram on smartphones, tablets, and even computers. We have apps for <a href="https://telegram.org/dl/ios">iOS</a> (11.0 and above), <a href="https://telegram.org/dl/android">Android</a> (6.0 and up), a native <a href="https://macos.telegram.org">macOS app</a> and a universal <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org">desktop app</a> for Windows, macOS, and Linux. <a href="https://web.telegram.org">Telegram Web</a> can also help to quickly do something on the go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can log in to Telegram from as many of your devices as you like — all <strong>at the same time</strong>. Just use your main mobile phone number to log in everywhere, your cloud chats will sync instantly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="//core.telegram.org/api">Telegram API</a> is open for developers, should you want to build your own applications for other platforms.  </p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-who-are-the-people-behind-telegram" href="#q-who-are-the-people-behind-telegram"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?</h4>
<p>Telegram is supported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov">Pavel Durov</a> and his brother Nikolai. Pavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai&#39;s input is technological. To make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers. As a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-where-is-telegram-based" href="#q-where-is-telegram-based"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Where is Telegram based?</h4>
<p>The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.</p>
<p>Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St. Petersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest#Winners">highly skilled engineers</a>. The Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore. We’re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.</p>

Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?</h4>
<p>No. See <a href="https://t.me/durov/142">this post</a> for details.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this" href="#q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?</h4>
<p>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.</p>
<p>Our founder and CEO <a href="/press">Pavel Durov</a>, who financed Telegram throughout most of its history, has outlined a <strong>strategy to make Telegram sustainable</strong> in <a href="https://t.me/durov/142">this post</a>.</p>
<p>Following this plan, Telegram has implemented sustainable forms of monetization that prioritize its users:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, Telegram launched <a href="https://t.me/durov/172">Sponsored Messages</a> – minimalist, privacy-conscious advertisements that can appear in certain public channels.</li>
<li>In 2022, Telegram launched a <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/700-million-and-premium#telegram-premium">Premium subscription</a> which users can purchase to both support the app and unlock additional exclusive features.</li>
</ul>
<p>These revenue streams help us pay for infrastructure costs and developer salaries, however making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-are-your-thoughts-on-internet-privacy" href="#q-what-are-your-thoughts-on-internet-privacy"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?</h4>
<p>We think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.</li>
<li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Telegram&#39;s aim is to create a truly free messenger, with a revolutionary <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-about-gdpr" href="#q-what-about-gdpr"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What about GDPR?</h4>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018. Since taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn&#39;t much we had to change. We don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we&#39;re not part of any <del>mafia family</del> “family of companies.”</p>
<p>Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service. For example, your cloud chats – so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts – so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram. Please see our <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The Regulation (EU) 2021/784 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2021 on addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online (Terrorist Content Online Regulation, or TCO Regulation) allows authorities in EU countries to send removal requests for terrorist content, if it is discovered on Telegram&#39;s public platform. We have also designated a third party, European Digital Services Representative (EDSR), to assist us with TCO-related communications.</p>
<p>Users whose publications were taken down in connection with the TCO Regulation can request details on why their publications were considered terrorist and how to challenge the removal:</p>
<ul>
<li>by writing to EDSR at Avenue Huart Hamoir 71, 1030 Brussels, Belgium, or</li>
<li>by contacting the <a href="https://t.me/EURegulation">@EURegulation</a> bot on Telegram and using the command <code>/tco_ask</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Requests can be accepted in English and French.</p>

<p><strong>Private groups and chats</strong> on Telegram are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them. However, Telegram also supports <strong>sticker sets</strong>, <strong>bots</strong>, <strong>channels</strong> and <strong>groups</strong> that are <em>publicly available</em>.</p>
<p>If you see a bot, channel, sticker set, or other content that is a part of Telegram’s public platform and is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to <a href="mailto:dmca@telegram.org">dmca@telegram.org</a>. Please note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-do-you-process-take-down-requests-from-third-parties" href="#q-do-you-process-take-down-requests-from-third-parties"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Do you process take-down requests from third parties?</h4>
<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet. To do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal <strong>public</strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, groups and channels) within the app. For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.</p>
<p>Public content on Telegram, such as user-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers, is not part of the core Telegram UI. Whenever we receive a report regarding potentially illegal public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>Please note that this does <strong>not</strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.  For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won&#39;t be a part of such politically motivated censorship. This goes against our founders&#39; <a href="https://mashable.com/2015/05/18/russias-mark-zuckerberg-pavel-durov/">principles</a>. While we do block terrorist (e.g. ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.</p>

<p><a href="#secret-chats">Secret chats</a> use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don&#39;t have any data to disclose.</p>
<p>To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure. Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.</p>
<p>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people&#39;s privacy and freedom of expression. Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.</p>
<p>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user messages to third parties, including governments. </p>

<p>Telegram allows third-party services to <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/gifts-verification-platform#verification-platform">send verification codes</a> to their users via Telegram. These codes only appear in the <strong>verified <em>&#39;Verification Codes&#39;</em> chat</strong>, and let you tap to instantly copy the code.</p>
<div>
  <a href="/file/400780400405/5/DJtYqf_wYiU.829923/a5d5fc8092802cab46" target="_blank">

  </a>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>Services that do not specify a name or profile picture for their codes will appear with the default name and photo of <em>&#39;Verification Codes&#39;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you receive a code in the <em>&#39;Verification Codes&#39;</em> chat, it&#39;s probably because you requested to log in to a third-party service, like an <strong>external website, app or marketplace</strong>. It&#39;s also possible that someone else accidentally entered your phone number when logging in to another service. <strong>Either way, your Telegram account is completely safe</strong> — if  you didn’t request a code, simply tap on it and select <em>&#39;Report&#39;</em>, no need to do anything else.</p>
<p>Third-party services determine which way your verification codes are sent – and Telegram is not able to control this or make a service aware of your preferences. Unlike SMS codes that frequently fail to arrive and can be interecepted, verification codes sent via Telegram are <strong>delivered instantly</strong> and are <strong>securely encrypted</strong> – making them safer and more reliable for both users and services.</p>
<p>The <em>&#39;Verification Codes&#39;</em> chat is only used for codes from <strong>third-party services</strong>. Login codes for your <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#getting-a-code-via-telegram">Telegram account</a> itself are sent to the <strong>verified service notifications</strong> chat named <em>&#39;Telegram&#39;</em> in your chat list and should <strong>never be shared</strong> with anyone, including other services or apps.</p>

<p>You can choose who sees this info in <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-revolution">Privacy and Security</a> settings.</p>
<p>Remember that you won&#39;t see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don&#39;t share your own. You will, however, see an approximate last seen value. This keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram. There are four possible approximate values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Last seen recently</strong> — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days</li>
<li><strong>Last seen within a week</strong> — between 2-3 and seven days</li>
<li><strong>Last seen within a month</strong> — between 6-7 days and a month</li>
<li><strong>Last seen a long time ago</strong> — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)</li>

<p>The <a href="#q-can-i-hide-my-last-seen-time">last seen</a> rules apply to your online status as well. People can only see you online if you&#39;re sharing your last seen status with them.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online. Regardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members.</li>
<li>Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.</li>
<li>Broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#39;re not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don&#39;t do anything of the above, they&#39;ll never see you online. Another way of achieving this is to block that person. </p>

#### Q: What is People Nearby?

People Nearby is an *optional* feature that allows Telegram users to **explore local groups**, **find friends** to chat with in their area, or quickly **exchange contacts** with people who are close.

You can find it in *Contacts > Find People Nearby*, as well as directly in the side menu on Android.

While you have the People Nearby section **open on your screen**, people who are *very close* will be able to see you there – so that it's easy to exachange contacts. If you don't open the section, others will **never** see you in 'People Nearby'.

> **Note:** People Nearby is **never turned on by default** – users must manually enable it. If you are receiving messages from someone you don't know, see [*Q: Who can contact me?*](#q-who-can-contact-me)

You can also choose to permanently add your profile to the list of nearby people by tapping **Make Myself Visible**. After becoming visible, you can remove your profile from the list at any time by tapping **Stop Showing Me**.

> To protect user privacy, 'People Nearby' always shows **distances to approximate locations** within an area that spans up to 800 meters in diameter. (This is affected by latitude, so if you're broadcasting your location from the Arctic Circle, it may be closer to 300 meters.)

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-can-i-delete-my-messages" href="#q-can-i-delete-my-messages"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Can I delete my messages?</h4>
<p>Yes. You can always delete any messages you <strong>sent</strong> or <strong>received</strong> for <em>both sides</em> in <em>any</em> one-on-one conversation (in groups, it&#39;s still your own messages only). You can also clear the entire chat history on both ends. On Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.</p>

<p>Together with privacy settings for <a href="/blog/unsend-privacy-emoji#anonymous-forwarding">forwarded messages</a>, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder). As a result, users no longer need to worry about the data accumulating in their chats over the years. Both parties in a conversation have full control over what does and what doesn&#39;t belong to their online identity.</p>

<p>If you want more participants, try starting a <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats">Voice Chat</a> in one of the <strong>groups</strong> you created. Voice Chats add a live layer of ephemeral talk to the group. They can be used as virtual office spaces for teams or informal lounges for any community.

<p>Telegram groups can have up to <strong>200,000 members</strong> each and are extremely powerful communication tools. Here are a few key features that make them stand out in the messaging world: </p>
<p><strong>Unified history</strong><br>Edit your messages after posting, delete them so that they disappear for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-platform availability</strong><br>Access your messages anytime, from any number of your mobile or desktop devices.</p>
<p><strong>Instant search</strong><br>Find the message you&#39;re looking for, even among millions. Filter by sender to make searching easier.</p>
<p><strong>Replies, mentions, hashtags</strong><br>Easily trace a conversation and keep communication efficient, no matter the group size.</p>
<p><strong>Smart notifications</strong><br>Mute the group to get notifications only when people mention you or reply to your messages.</p>
<p><strong>Pinned messages</strong><br>You can pin any message to be displayed at the top of the chat screen. All members will get a notification — even if they muted ordinary messages from your group.</p>
<p><strong>Moderation tools</strong><br>Appoint administrators that can mass-delete messages, control membership, and pin important messages. Define their admin privileges with granular precision.</p>
<p><strong>Group permissions</strong><br>Set default permissions to restrict all members from posting specific kinds of content. Or even restrict members from sending messages altogether – and let the admins chat amongst themselves while everybody else is watching.</p>
<p><strong>File sharing</strong><br>Send and receive files of any type, up to 2 GB in size each, access them instantly on your other devices.</p>
<p><strong>Public groups</strong><br>Get a <a href="#usernames-and-t-me">short link</a> for your group and make it public, like <a href="https://t.me/publictestgroup">t.me/publictestgroup</a>. This way, anybody can view the group&#39;s entire chat history and join to post messages.</p>
<p><strong>Customization via bots</strong><br>Create custom tools for any specific needs using our <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots">Bot API</a> and <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline">Inline Bots</a>.</p>

<p>Telegram <strong>groups</strong> are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams. But groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members. You can make any group <strong>public</strong>, toggle <strong>persistent history</strong> to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint <strong>administrators</strong> with granular privileges. You can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined.</p>
<p><strong>Channels</strong> are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences. In fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers. When you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel&#39;s name and photo and not your own. Each message in a channel has a <strong>view counter</strong> that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies.</p>

<p>You can set a <strong>public</strong> username on Telegram. It then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username – you will appear in search under &#39;global results&#39;. Please note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don&#39;t know your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting a username on Telegram.</p>
<p>You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.</p>

<p>Collectible usernames work just like <a href="#q-what-are-usernames-how-do-i-get-one">basic usernames</a>, they appear in Global Search results and have their own links that can be used outside of Telegram: username.t.me and t.me/username.</p>
<p>They can be bought and sold through third-party platforms like <a href="https://fragment.com/">Fragment</a>, giving a <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>secure</strong> way to acquire and exchange valuable Telegram domains. Acquiring a collectible username gives permanent ownership, verified by the TON blockchain. Owners of collectible usernames can freely <strong>assign them</strong> to chats, <strong>sell them</strong> to others, or <strong>keep them</strong> for later use.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-does-t-me-work" href="#q-how-does-t-me-work"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How does t.me work?</h4>
<p>Once you&#39;ve set a username, you can give people a <a href="https://t.me/username">t.me/username</a> or a <a href="https://username.t.me">username.t.me</a> link. Opening either of those links on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you. You can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.</p>
<p>This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to set up a public username and don’t mind sharing your number, you can also create a t.me link <a href="/blog/downloads-attachments-streaming#phone-number-links">with your phone number</a> in <strong>international format</strong> – for example, <strong>t.me/+123456789</strong>. This type of link can quickly open a chat with you from any app, however, it will only work if your <a href="#q-who-can-see-my-phone-number">privacy settings</a> let others find you by your phone number.</p>

Remember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don&#39;t have your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-if-someone-finds-me-by-username-messages-and-i-reply-will-they" href="#q-if-someone-finds-me-by-username-messages-and-i-reply-will-they"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number?</h4>
<p>No. Neither party will see another&#39;s phone number (unless this is permitted by your <a href="#q-who-can-see-my-phone-number">privacy settings</a>). This is similar to the case when you message a person who you&#39;ve met in a Telegram group.</p>

<p>Go to Settings and save an empty username. This will remove your username; people will no longer be able to find you via search. This will not affect existing conversations.</p>

<p>There are two types of username on Telegram, <a href="#q-what-are-usernames-how-do-i-get-one">basic usernames</a> and <a href="#q-what-are-collectible-usernames-how-are-they-different-from-bas">collectible usernames</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Usernames</strong></p>
<p>Telegram <strong>basic</strong> usernames are distributed on a first-come – first-serve basis.</p>
<p>We understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some of us. If your desired username is already taken and it is <strong>not registered as a collectible</strong>, we can help you acquire it for your account or channel, provided that you have that same username on at least two of these services: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that one account can register multiple bot and channel usernames, we reserve the right to recall usernames assigned to unused bots and channels, as well as openly squatted usernames.<br>To request a username, contact <a href="https://t.me/Username_bot">@Username_bot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Collectible Usernames</strong><br>If you want a collectible username but it is taken, you should check if it is available for <a href="https://fragment.com/">sale</a>. We cannot assign collectible usernames, they can only be managed by their <strong>respective owners</strong>.</p>

<p>Telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line. We are based on the MTProto protocol (see <a href="https://core.telegram.org/mtproto">description</a> and <a href="https://core.telegram.org/techfaq">advanced FAQ</a>), built upon time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections.

<p>We&#39;ve got you covered. Telegram’s special <a href="#secret-chats">secret chats</a> use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding. On top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-so-how-do-you-encrypt-data" href="#q-so-how-do-you-encrypt-data"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: So how do you encrypt data?</h4>
<p>We support two layers of secure encryption. <a href="https://core.telegram.org/mtproto">Server-client encryption</a> is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of <a href="https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end">client-client encryption</a>. All data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files.</p>
<p>Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. You can find more info in the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/techfaq">Advanced FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication. This means that all data (including media and files) that you send and receive via Telegram cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your internet service provider, owners of Wi-Fi routers you connect to, or other third parties.</p>
<p>But please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she takes your unlocked phone without a passcode. Or from your IT-department if they access your computer at work. Or from any other people that get physical or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser">root</a> access to your phones or computers running Telegram.</p>
<p>If you have reasons to worry about your personal security, we strongly recommend using only <a href="#secret-chats">Secret Chats</a> in official or at least verifiable open-source apps for sensitive information, preferably with a <a href="#q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work">self-destruct timer</a>. We also recommend enabling 2-Step Verification and setting up a strong passcode to lock your app, you will find both options in Settings &gt; Privacy and Security.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-does-2-step-verification-work" href="#q-how-does-2-step-verification-work"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How does 2-Step Verification work?</h4>
<p>Logging in with an SMS code is an industry standard in messaging, but if you&#39;re looking for more security or have reasons to doubt your mobile carrier or government, we recommend protecting your cloud chats with an additional password.</p>
<p>You can do this in <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; 2-Step Verification</strong>. Once enabled, you will need both an SMS code and a password to log in. You can also set up a recovery email address that will help regain access, should you forget your password. If you do so, please remember that it&#39;s important that the recovery email account is also protected with a strong password and 2-Step Verification when possible.</p>

<p>Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser">root access</a>.</p>
<p>A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage#filesInternal">internal storage</a>. Once an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile. No application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="secret-chats" href="#secret-chats"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Secret Chats</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-are-secret-chats-different" href="#q-how-are-secret-chats-different"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How are secret chats different?</h4>
<p>Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella. All messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (<a href="#q-can-telegram-protect-me-against-everything">more on this here</a>). On top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats. And when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well.</p>
<p>You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to <a href="#q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work">self-destruct</a> in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient. The message will then disappear from both your and your friend&#39;s devices.</p>
<p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud. This means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin. They are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-i-start-a-secret-chat" href="#q-how-do-i-start-a-secret-chat"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do I start a secret chat?</h4>
<p>Open the profile of the user you want to contact. Tap on ‘…’, then ‘Start Secret Chat’.</p>
<p>Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific. If you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device. If you log out, you will lose all your secret chats. You can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work" href="#q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do self-destructing messages work?</h4>
<p>The Self-Destruct Timer is available for <strong>all messages</strong> in Secret Chats and for <strong>media</strong> in private cloud chats.</p>
<p>To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit. The clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient&#39;s screen (gets two check marks). As soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from <strong>both</strong> devices. We will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken.</p>
<p>Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent <strong>after</strong> the timer was set. It has no effect on earlier messages.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-can-i-be-certain-that-my-conversation-partner-doesn-39t-take-a" href="#q-can-i-be-certain-that-my-conversation-partner-doesn-39t-take-a"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Can I be certain that my conversation partner doesn&#39;t take a screenshot?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices). We will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently. We advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust. After all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with a different device or an old school camera.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-is-this-39encryption-key-39-thing" href="#q-what-is-this-39encryption-key-39-thing"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What is this &#39;Encryption Key&#39; thing?</h4>
<p>When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a>. After the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat. You can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle attack</a> can succeed.</p>
<p>Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app.</p>
<p>Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it&#39;s safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-why-not-just-make-all-chats-39secret-39" href="#q-why-not-just-make-all-chats-39secret-39"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Why not just make all chats &#39;secret&#39;?</h4>
<p>All Telegram messages are always securely encrypted. Messages in Secret Chats use <strong>client-client</strong> encryption, while Cloud Chats use <strong>client-server/server-client</strong> encryption and are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#4-1-storing-data">here</a>). This enables your cloud messages to be both <a href="#q-do-you-process-data-requests">secure</a> and immediately accessible from any of your devices – even if you lose your device altogether.</p>
<p>The problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected device (e.g. when you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in the end-to-end encryption paradigm. At the same time, reliable backups are an essential feature for any mass-market messenger. To solve this problem, some applications (like Whatsapp and Viber) allow <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/where-whatsapp-went-wrong-effs-four-biggest-security-concerns">decryptable backups</a> that put their users&#39; privacy at risk – even if they do not enable backups themselves. Other apps ignore the need for backups altogether and leave their users vulnerable to data loss.</p>
<p>We opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats. Telegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of Cloud Chats. Meanwhile, the separate entity of Secret Chats gives you full control over the data you do not want to be stored.</p>
<p>This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries. We are convinced that the separation of conversations into Cloud and Secret chats represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular messaging application.</p>

<p>Each phone number is a <strong>separate</strong> account on Telegram. You have several options if you are using multiple phone numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you will <strong>no longer use the old number</strong> (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to Settings and <a href="#q-how-do-i-change-my-phone-number">change the number</a> connected to your Telegram account to the new number. <strong>Important:</strong> make sure you have access to your connected phone number – otherwise you risk losing access to your account.</li>
<li>If you will use the new number for a <strong>limited time</strong> (e.g., you&#39;re on a trip or vacation), there&#39;s no need to do anything.</li>
<li>If you want to keep using <strong>both numbers</strong> (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number. You <em>may</em> create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated.

<ul>
<li>You can use Telegram on many devices <strong>at the same time</strong>. Just use the same phone number to log in on all devices.</li>
<li>You can go to <em>Settings &gt; Data and Storage &gt; Storage Usage&gt; Clear cache</em> to <strong>free up space</strong> on your device without logging out.</li>
<li>If you use Telegram with <strong>multiple phone numbers</strong>, you can <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/themes-accounts#multiple-accounts">switch between accounts</a> without logging out.</li>
<li>If you use Telegram on a <strong>shared device</strong>, you can set up a passcode in <em>Settings &gt; Privacy and Security</em> to make sure only you have access to your account.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do want to log out for some reason, here&#39;s how you do that:</p>
<p><em>iOS</em>: Go to Settings &gt; Edit &gt; Log out.<br><em>Android</em>, <em>Telegram Desktop</em>: Go to Settings &gt; … (in the top right corner) &gt; Log out.</p>
<p>If you log out, you will keep all your cloud messages. However, you <strong>will lose</strong> all your <strong>Secret Chats</strong> and <strong>all messages</strong> inside those secret chats when you log out.</p>

<p>Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn&#39;t much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft. But if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to <a href="#i-have-access-to-telegram-on-another-device">log out the other device</a>, it is best that you wipe it remotely. You can read more about it here: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2701">Apple iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager">Android</a>. Unfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario.</p>
<p>You can <a href="#q-how-do-i-delete-my-account">delete your Telegram account</a> if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop). Note that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 18 months being the default setting.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-are-bots" href="#q-what-are-bots"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What are bots?</h4>
<p>Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram. They are made by third-party developers using the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots">Telegram Bot API</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-i-create-a-bot" href="#q-how-do-i-create-a-bot"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do I create a bot?</h4>
<p>Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming. If you&#39;re sure you&#39;re up to it, our <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots"><strong>Introduction for Developers</strong></a> is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer. But we&#39;re sure you&#39;ll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-a-bot-is-sending-me-messages-how-do-i-make-it-stop" href="#q-a-bot-is-sending-me-messages-how-do-i-make-it-stop"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop?</h4>
<p>If you don&#39;t want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as you would block a human user. Some Telegram clients have a &#39;Stop Bot&#39; button right in the bot&#39;s profile.</p>
<p>That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its <em>/help</em> for clues.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-are-bots-safe" href="#q-are-bots-safe"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Are bots safe?</h4>
<p>Yes. Bots are no different from human users that you meet in groups for example. They can see your public name, username, and profile pictures, and they can see messages you send to them, that&#39;s it. They can&#39;t access your last seen status and <strong>don&#39;t</strong> see your phone number (unless you decide to give it to them yourself).</p>
<p>Naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger — don&#39;t give them your passwords, Telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely. Also, be careful when opening files sent by bots, same as you would deal with ordinary humans. Example: If a bot sent us a file called <em>OpenMe.exe</em>, we probably wouldn&#39;t open it.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-if-i-add-a-bot-to-my-group-can-it-read-my-messages" href="#q-if-i-add-a-bot-to-my-group-can-it-read-my-messages"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: If I add a bot to my group, can it read my messages?</h4>
<p>Bots can work in two modes when you add them to groups. By default, bots only see messages that are meant for them. In this case, you&#39;ll see &#39;has no access to messages&#39; in the group members list next to the bot.</p>
<p>Some bots need more information to work, so developers may disable the privacy mode. In this case, the bot will see all messages sent to the group, and you will see &#39;has access to messages&#39; in the members list next to the bot.</p>
<p><a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode">Learn more about privacy mode for bots »</a></p>
<p>If your group contains very sensitive information, maybe it&#39;s better to avoid adding bots you don&#39;t trust 100%.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-are-bots-made-by-telegram" href="#q-are-bots-made-by-telegram"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Are bots made by Telegram?</h4>
<p>No. While we have some official bots for specific purposes (like <a href="https://t.me/gif">@gif</a> or <a href="https://t.me/Stickers">@Stickers</a>, we don&#39;t usually make bots. Bots are made by third-party developers using the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots">Telegram Bot API and platform</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-where-can-i-find-more-bots" href="#q-where-can-i-find-more-bots"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Where can I find more bots?</h4>
<p>There is no official store at the moment, so you&#39;ll have to ask your friends or search the web for now. We&#39;re pretty sure you&#39;ll find some bots to play with.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-can-i-get-telegram-39s-server-side-code" href="#q-can-i-get-telegram-39s-server-side-code"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Can I get Telegram&#39;s server-side code?</h4>
<p>All Telegram client apps are fully open source. We offer <a href="https://core.telegram.org/reproducible-builds">verifiable builds both for iOS and Android</a> – this technology allows to independently verify that the application you download from the app stores was built using the <strong>exact same code</strong> that we publish.</p>
<p>By contrast, publishing the server code doesn’t provide security guarantees neither for Secret Chats nor for Cloud Chats. This is because – unlike with the client-side code – there’s no way to verify that the <strong>same code</strong> is run on the servers.</p>
<p>As for Secret Chats, you don’t need the server-side code to check their integrity – the point of end-to-end encryption is that it must be solid regardless of how the servers function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://t.me/durov/146">post on his channel</a>, Pavel Durov explained why Telegram hasn&#39;t published the server code, even as a publicity stunt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://core.telegram.org/mtproto">encryption</a> and <a href="https://core.telegram.org">API</a> used on Telegram&#39;s servers are fully documented and open for review by security experts. We welcome any comments at <em>security@telegram.org</em></p>

<p>Our architecture does not support federation yet. Telegram is a unified cloud service, so creating forks where two users might end up on two different Telegram clouds is unacceptable. To enable you to run your own Telegram server while retaining both speed and security is a task in itself. At the moment, we are undecided on whether or not Telegram should go in this direction.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-can-i-use-the-telegram-api" href="#q-can-i-use-the-telegram-api"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Can I use the Telegram API?</h4>

<p>One is our <a href="https://macos.telegram.org">app for macOS</a>, the other is Telegram Lite, the macOS version of our <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org">multi-platform client</a>. Both apps are official. Both started out as unofficial applications by two different developers and vary in design and functionality.</p>
<p><a href="https://macos.telegram.org">Telegram for macOS</a> supports many platform-specific features, such as the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, gesture navigation, integration with the Mac&#39;s Share menu and more. It has every feature from the iOS version of the app including Secret Chats.</p>
<p><a href="https://desktop.telegram.org">Telegram Lite</a> is a lightning-fast app, optimized for work-related tasks and handling large communities. It offers a three-column interface, perfect for multitasking and quick access to media, files and links shared in your chats.

<p>To delete a contact, open a chat with the person, tap the title in the top area of the chat screen to open their profile, then tap on (⋮) in the top right corner &gt; &#39;Delete contact&#39;.</p>

<p>Secret Chats are established between the two devices they were created on. This means that all those messages are not available in the cloud and cannot be accessed on other devices.</p>
<p>Moreover, Secret Chats are also tied to your current login session on the device. If you log out and in again, you will lose all your Secret Chats.</p>

<p>When users report unwanted messages from a Telegram account, we apply a limit: Reported accounts can only send messages to people who have their number saved as a contact.</p>
<p>This means that if you randomly contact people you don&#39;t know and send them annoying messages, you may lose the ability to do so in the future.</p>

<p>Telegram can use the <strong>microphone</strong> in the background if you minimize the app when making a call, recording a video, or recording a voice/video message.</p>
<p>Permission monitors on Samsung and Xiaomi can inadvertently flag and notify you that Telegram requested access to <strong>camera</strong> in the background. This happens when the app requests info about the camera — it isn’t using the camera. Unfortunately it may look the same to the Samsung and Xiaomi permission monitors.</p>
<p>Camera info is requested by the app when you tap on the attachment button, or start recording a video or a video message. If you do this and quickly close the app, the already initiated request may try to run asynchronously when the app is already in the background, or be sent when the system wakes up the app to show a notification about a new message. In any case, these requests are only for the camera info, the app <em>never</em> uses the camera itself in the background.</p>
<p>Anyone can check Telegram’s <a href="https://telegram.org/apps#source-code">open source code</a> and confirm that the app is not doing anything behind their back. We also offer <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/verifiable-apps-and-more">reproducible builds</a> that can help you prove that the version you downloaded from App Store or Google Play is built from the exact same source code we publish.</p>
