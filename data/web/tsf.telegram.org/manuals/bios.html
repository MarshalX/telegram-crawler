<p>Never hesitate to ask for help in your local TSF group. But remember: Not everyone in your group uses the same support account and speaks the same languages as you. When you want to ask something:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a <strong>summary</strong> of the user&#39;s question in one message (don&#39;t copy-paste, be brief)</li>
<li>Always use <strong>English</strong> (there are team members in your group who don&#39;t speak your language)</li>
<li>Always include the entire <strong>footer</strong> from the question (all hashtags)</li>
</ol>

<h3><a class="anchor-link" href="#2-tracing-your-progress"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a><a class="anchor" name="2-tracing-your-progress"></a>2. Tracing your progress</h3>
<p>You can check our <a href="/">TSF Panel</a> to see your stats and how you compare against other TSF members. You can also add a little TSF Bio in the panel, so that others know more about you, what you like, what you do, what devices you have and what languages you can speak.</p>

<p>The Telegram Support Force is full of brilliant and creative people, and there are many more useful things that can be done besides answering questions. Global events are announcements in our notifications chat, and you can also start your own projects together with interested teammates.</p>
<p>If you have suggestions and ideas for the general workings of the TSF, our internal communication, manuals, templates, interfaces, tools and so on, don&#39;t hesitate to contact Markus or Daria about it. Oh, and: Rude frescoes. If you have no idea what this last thing was about, read on to the end of this document.</p>
<!--
If you're interested in doing more, check out the TSF Projects board where you'll find a list of currently active projects initiated by our TSF members. Find one to your liking or just [sign up](https://trello.com/c/Km5faOdu/2-how-can-i-help) to be notified when something that requires your skills is going on.

The list of projects is not very long for now, but we're working on adding more. If you have an idea for a project, see [this card](https://trello.com/c/ktEz53WR/38-what-if-i-have-a-project-idea).
-->

<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you&#39;ve just joined the TSF and are still figuring out what&#39;s going on, we&#39;d suggest not to get too involved with things like side projects. It&#39;s a better idea to first get comfortable with answering user questions before you spread out.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a class="anchor-link" href="#7-security-questions"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a><a class="anchor" name="7-security-questions"></a>7. Security questions</h3>
<p>Stick to the FAQ in case of ordinary users. <strong>Always</strong> consult Markus (unless the matter is fully covered in the Bestiary). If Markus is not available at the moment, ask in your local group. Don&#39;t be afraid to tell an advanced user that you are not a specialist — you don&#39;t have to be.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask users for the source of their doubts, most likely you&#39;ll get a link</li>
<li><a href="/techfaq">Advanced FAQ</a> gives more info about MTProto for advanced users.</li>
<li>Advanced concerns and questions should be mailed to <strong>security@telegram.org</strong></li>
</ol>
<!--
To use trello search for links, remove the http(s):// part. E.g.:

<div>
    <a href="/file/811140900/1/MFYP2Cb7EC0/1741dcf258433dd879" target="_blank"><img src="/file/811140900/1/MFYP2Cb7EC0/1741dcf258433dd879" title="Screenshot_44.png, 16.6Kb"  class="dev_page_image" /></a>
</div>

Trello search is not perfect for links even this way, so may be a good idea to take a personal look at the Bestiary if the search doesn't return anything. New links for problems that are covered in the Bestiary should be added to the relevant cards.

<h3><a class="anchor-link" href="#8-new-language-requests"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a><a class="anchor" name="8-new-language-requests"></a>8. New language requests</h3>
<p>Anyone can use the <a href="https://translations.telegram.org">Translation platform</a> to suggest improvements to our current translations — or create their own custom language packs and translate Telegram into any language.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-can-i-translate-telegram">Translations instructions in the FAQ</a></li>
<li><a href="https://translations.telegram.org/">Translations section</a></li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="anchor-link" href="#9-join-support-force-requests"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a><a class="anchor" name="9-join-support-force-requests"></a>9. Join support force requests</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t give our manifesto to just anybody. Try to see if the user is reasonable. If not, you can tell them that finding how to join us is the first test.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor-link" href="#10-media-requests"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a><a class="anchor" name="10-media-requests"></a>10. Media requests</h3>
<p>Explain that you&#39;re a volunteer and can&#39;t handle press requests, but they can submit a request to <a href="https://t.me/PressBot">@PressBot</a>.</p>
<p>Never promise anything. Be extra careful when handling <strong>any</strong> questions from journalists. If it&#39;s something related to simple Telegram features, reply – but make sure they understand that you&#39;ve volunteered to help users in support and are not a spokesperson for Telegram.</p>
<p>If it&#39;s anything more complicated, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touches on <strong>any</strong> sensitive subjects like encryption, privacy, moderation, etc. <strong>in any way</strong></li>
<li>Contains a <strong>list of questions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt; Simply direct to <a href="https://t.me/PressBot">@PressBot</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor-link" href="#11-legal-stuff"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a><a class="anchor" name="11-legal-stuff"></a>11. Legal stuff</h3>
<p>You as our volunteers are not trained in legal matters, so it&#39;s safer to do <strong>nothing at all</strong>, should you encounter any kind of legal requests. Lawyers know how to reach us. So simply ignore those messages, do not open, do not reply, do not worry. We&#39;ll handle everything.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor-link" href="#12-secret-words"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a><a class="anchor" name="12-secret-words"></a>12. Secret words</h3>
<p>By the way, when reading our manuals, you will sometimes notice words that are <strong>definitely</strong> out of place. For example, a text may at some point say something like <em>Bionic sycophants</em> out of the blue – only in real life the strange words won&#39;t be highlighted in italics. If you find such words in our manuals, talk to <a href="https://t.me/gladosbot">@Gladosbot</a> and send her the <strong>/sendsecret</strong> command (without parameters). The bot will ask you for the secret words you&#39;ve found and respond if you&#39;ve entered them correctly.</p>
<p>Try this now with the secret words you&#39;ve just found in the paragraph above – and keep your eyes opened for more of them in other documents. Please don&#39;t neglect this! Secret words help us understand whether or not you are up to date on our docs in a friendly way.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor-link" href="#13-spam-related-requests"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a><a class="anchor" name="13-spam-related-requests"></a>13. Spam-related requests</h3>
<p>Some users will complain that they were unfairly limited to only sending messages to their mutual contacts. We at the TSF do not have the tools to handle such requests, but our friendly <a href="https://t.me/spambot">@spambot</a> is always ready to help them – and it speaks many different languages, including those that we don&#39;t. Feel free to send the <em>spambot</em> template to such users. If they keep insisting that you do something about their situation, it is OK to ignore them.</p>
<p>Some users will have you believe that somebody reported them &#39;for fun&#39; or &#39;by mistake&#39;, but the reality is usually very different. We have a dedicated team of moderators that process every report aided by sophisticated algorithms, so it is not easy to get limited by mistake. Naturally, both humans and algorithms can err, but the <a href="https://t.me/spambot">@spambot</a> has all the tools necessary for filing an appeal.</p>
<p>And remember: the vast, absolute majority of Telegram users never get reported at all, most reports are declined, and most of the people that do get limited never even notice it. They can talk to anyone they&#39;ve talked to before, they can reply to any messages other people send them, and the initial limitation lasts for only a short period of time. Most likely, you wouldn&#39;t notice if we limited your account for a week or even a month.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor-link" href="#14-abuse-requests"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a><a class="anchor" name="14-abuse-requests"></a>14. Abuse requests</h3>
<p>The Telegram Support Force is an organization of volunteers that exists to help Telegram users find their way around the apps; you, our volunteers, are <strong>not qualified</strong> to solve cases involving illegal content — and neither am I (Markus). It is not an issue of trust, rather consider this:</p>
<ol>
<li>We would like our volunteers to be safe from possible legal consequences in case of misunderstandings and incorrectly handled cases.</li>
<li>Exposure to certain materials can result in life-long mental scarring, so we want to leave this to professionals that choose to handle such materials for a living.</li>
</ol>
<p>For these good reasons the Telegram abuse department is <strong>completely separate</strong> from the TSF and is staffed by professionals and not volunteers. It is their job to deal with any public content and abuse-related disputes. Please tell users to write to <a href="mailto:abuse@telegram.org">abuse@telegram.org</a> and include all the details and links — or use the built-in report buttons in our apps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note: spam@telegram.org is <strong>NOT</strong> used for complaints <strong>about</strong> spam. <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#can-39t-send-messages-to-non-contacts">More info</a></p>

<p>If the user gets an error when trying to buy a subscription, please ask for the screenshot, then report it to the local group together their footer and story, and add the <code>#payments</code> hashtag to your report.</p>
