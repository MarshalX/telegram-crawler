<description>This Telegram update adds a few major improvements:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• EMOJI CATEGORIES: Filter stickers and emoji by categories like "love", "celebration" or "sleeping" in the sticker and emoji tabs.&lt;br&gt;• CHAT TRANSLATION: As a Premium user, translate entire chats in real time as you scroll them or receive new messages.&lt;br&gt;• NETWORK USAGE: Check how much of your data was spent on Telegram in the updated Network Usage section in Settings.&lt;br&gt;• MEDIA PERMISSIONS IN GROUPS: Control whether members of your groups can send 9 distinct media types – like Photos, Voice or Video Messages.&lt;br&gt;• TRENDING EMOJI: As a Premium user, check out trending emoji packs in the emoji panel and long press an emoji to zoom in.&lt;br&gt;• SELECT CHATS FOR BOTS: Bot developers can now let users quickly select groups, channels or contacts that meet predefined criteria (more in @BotNews).&lt;br&gt;• This release also contains crash fix for macOS 10.12.6 and other improvements.</description>

<description>HIDDEN MEDIA, ZERO STORAGE USAGE, NEW DRAWING TOOLS, PROFILE PICTURES FOR YOUR CONTACTS, AND PUPPIES&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We found someone's letter to Santa and implemented everything on the list:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hidden Media&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Media with spoiler effects. You can wrap photos and videos you send in a fuzzy cover by selecting media in the attachment menu and tapping (⋯) &gt; Hide With Spoiler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zero Storage Usage&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Auto-remove cached media. You can choose how long cached media is kept in Private Chats, Groups, and Channels – and add exceptions for specific chats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Removing media by type. Separate tabs with Media, Files, and Music from all chats let you quickly clear the largest files. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Pie charts. The new design helps you see what's taking up space. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Dwarves with calculators. Cache size is now calculated a lot faster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Reminder: All cached media you remove remains accessible in the cloud and can be re-downloaded if needed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Profile Pictures for Your Contacts&lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;• Setting pictures for your contacts. You can choose your own picture for a contact – only you will see it on their profile.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;• Suggested profile pictures. When editing your contacts, you can suggest a photo for their profile. It will take them just two taps to add the picture you suggested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Public profile pictures. If you only allow certain users to see your profile photos, you can set a public picture for everyone else. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Ultimate profile picture privacy. You can set 'Who can see my profile photos' to 'Nobody' and add some users or groups as exceptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hiding Members in Large Groups&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Member list privacy. Owners of large groups can hide the list of members. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The letter also mentioned taking over the world and a puppy, but we hope the real Santa will be able to handle that – now that we've done the rest.</description>
